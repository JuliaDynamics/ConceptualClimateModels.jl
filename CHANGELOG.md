# v1.1

## `CloudToppedMixedLayerModel`

- Additional function for calculating the liquid water path analytically, scaling with the cloud thickness squared.
- Introduced more height-related variables to make codebase more clear. In particular, now CLT corresponds to the physical cloud layer thickness in meters. A new variable RCT (Relative Cloud Thickness) corresponds to what CLT used to be, i.e., RCT = CLT/`z_b`. The cloud height variable `z_cb` for cloud base height is computed explicitly now, and the RCT, RCT variables are automatically generated by default equations. The defaults of all equations and variable connections are so that there is no breaking change with these new variables. But if you were using directly `CLT` then you need to adjust it to `RCT`.
- Function `cloud_layer_thickness` removed in favour of `cloud_base_height` which clarifies better what each variable means and how it is computed.

# v1

Changelog of ConceptualClimateModels.jl is kept w.r.t. v1.
In this first stable release the submodule-based approach is finalized and a new submodule (`CloudToppedMixedLayerModel`) has been added.
