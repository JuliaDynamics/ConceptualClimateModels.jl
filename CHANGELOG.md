# v1.1

## `CloudToppedMixedLayerModel`

- Additional function for calculating the liquid water path analytically, scaling with the cloud thickness squared.
- Introduced more height-related variables to make codebase more clear. In particular, now RCT corresponds to the physical cloud layer thickness in meters. A new variable RCT (Relative Cloud Thickness) corresponds to what RCT used to be, i.e., RCT = RCT/`z_b`. The cloud height variable `z_cb` for cloud base height is computed explicitly now, and the RCT, RCT variables are automatically generated by default equations.


# v1

Changelog of ConceptualClimateModels.jl is kept w.r.t. v1.
In this first stable release the submodule-based approach is finalized and a new submodule (`CloudToppedMixedLayerModel`) has been added.
