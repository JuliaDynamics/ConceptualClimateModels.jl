@article{Bastiaansen2023,
abstract = {Climate response metrics are used to quantify the Earth's climate response to anthropogenic changes of atmospheric CO2. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is one such metric that measures the equilibrium response to CO2 doubling. However, both in their estimation and their usage, such metrics make assumptions on the linearity of climate response, although it is known that, especially for larger forcing levels, response can be nonlinear. Such nonlinear responses may become visible immediately in response to a larger perturbation, or may only become apparent after a long transient period. In this paper, we illustrate some potential problems and caveats when estimating ECS from transient simulations. We highlight ways that very slow time scales may lead to poor estimation of ECS even if there is seemingly good fit to linear response over moderate time scales. Moreover, such slow processes might lead to late abrupt responses (late tipping points) associated with a system's nonlinearities. We illustrate these ideas using simulations on a global energy balance model with dynamic albedo. We also discuss the implications for estimating ECS for global climate models, highlighting that it is likely to remain difficult to make definitive statements about the simulation times needed to reach an equilibrium.},

abstract = {Abstract New calculations of the radiative forcing (RF) are presented for the three main well-mixed greenhouse gases, methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide. Methane's RF is particularly impacted because of the inclusion of the shortwave forcing; the 1750–2011 RF is about 25\% higher (increasing from 0.48 W m−2 to 0.61 W m−2) compared to the value in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 assessment; the 100 year global warming potential is 14\% higher than the IPCC value. We present new simplified expressions to calculate RF. Unlike previous expressions used by IPCC, the new ones include the overlap between CO2 and N2O; for N2O forcing, the CO2 overlap can be as important as the CH4 overlap. The 1750–2011 CO2 RF is within 1\% of IPCC's value but is about 10\% higher when CO2 amounts reach 2000 ppm, a value projected to be possible under the extended RCP8.5 scenario.},

abstract = {The hemispheric symmetry of albedo and its contributing factors in satellite observations and global climate models is evaluated. The analysis is performed on the annual mean time scale, on which a bimodality in the joint distribution of albedo and cloud fraction is evident, resulting from tropical and subtropical clouds and midlatitude clouds, respectively. Hemispheric albedo symmetry is not found in individual ocean-only latitude bands; comparing the Northern and Southern Hemisphere (NH and SH), regional mean albedo is higher in the NH tropics and lower in the NH subtropics and midlatitudes than in the SH counterparts. This follows the hemispheric asymmetry of cloud fraction. In midlatitudes and tropics the hemispheric asymmetry in cloud albedo also contributes to the asymmetry in total albedo, whereas in the subtropics the cloud albedo is more hemispherically symmetric. According to the observations, cloud contributions to compensation for higher clear-sky albedo in the NH come primarily from cloud albedo in midlatitudes and cloud amount in the subtropics. Current-generation climate models diverge in their representation of these relationships, but common features of the model-data comparison include weaker-than-observed asymmetry in cloud fraction and cloud albedo in the tropics, weaker or reversed cloud fraction asymmetry in the subtropics, and agreement with observed cloud albedo asymmetry in the midlatitudes. Models on average reproduce the NH-SH asymmetry in total albedo over the 60°S-60°N ocean but show higher occurrence of brighter clouds in the SH compared to observations. The albedo bias in both hemispheres is reinforced by overestimated clear-sky albedo in the models.},

Using these observational data as a reference, we examine the degree to which 26 climate models capture this feature of the near-global marine cloud population. Models show a general increase in albedo with increasing cloud fraction, but none of them display a relation that is as well defined as that characterizing the observations. Models typically display larger albedo variability at a given cloud fraction, larger sensitivity in albedo to changes in cloud fraction, and lower cloud fractions. Several models also show branched distributions, contrasting with the smooth observational relation.

abstract = {There is evidence that ice age cycles are paced by astronomical forcing, suggesting some kind of synchronisation phenomenon. Here, we identify the type of such synchronisation and explore systematically its uniqueness and robustness using a simple paleoclimate model akin to the van der Pol relaxation oscillator and dynamical system theory. As the insolation is quite a complex quasiperiodic signal involving different frequencies, the traditional concepts used to define synchronisation to periodic forcing are no longer applicable. Instead, we explore a different concept of generalised synchronisation in terms of (coexisting) synchronised solutions for the forced system, their basins of attraction and instabilities. We propose a clustering technique to compute the number of synchronised solutions, each of which corresponds to a different paleoclimate history. In this way, we uncover multistable synchronisation (reminiscent of phase- or frequency-locking to individual periodic components of astronomical forcing) at low forcing strength, and monostable or unique synchronisation at stronger forcing. In the multistable regime, different initial conditions may lead to different paleoclimate histories. To study their robustness, we analyse Lyapunov exponents that quantify the rate of convergence towards each synchronised solution (local stability), and basins of attraction that indicate critical levels of external perturbations (global stability). We find that even though synchronised solutions are stable on a long term, there exist short episodes of desynchronisation where nearby climate trajectories diverge temporarily (for about 50 kyr). As the attracting trajectory can sometimes lie close to the boundary of its basin of attraction, a small perturbation could quite easily make climate to jump between different histories, reducing the predictability. Our study brings new insight into paleoclimate dynamics and reveals a possibility for the climate system to wander throughout different climatic histories related to preferential synchronisation regimes on obliquity, precession or combinations of both, all over the history of the Pleistocene. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is a key predictor of climate change. However, it is not very well constrained, either by climate models or by observational data. The reasons for this include strong internal variability and forcing on many time scales. In practise this means that the 'equilibrium' will only be relative to fixing the slow feedback processes before comparing palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations. In addition, information from the late Pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that the climate cycles between cold and warm regimes, and the climate sensitivity varies considerably between regime because of fast feedback processes changing relative strength and time scales over one cycle. In this paper we consider climate sensitivity for quite general climate dynamics. Using a conceptual Earth system model of Gildor and Tziperman (2001) (with Milankovich forcing and dynamical ocean biogeochemistry) we explore various ways of quantifying the state-dependence of climate sensitivity from unperturbed and perturbed model time series. Even without considering any perturbations, we suggest that climate sensitivity can be usefully thought of as a distribution that quantifies variability within the 'climate attractor' and where there is a strong dependence on climate state and more specificially on the 'climate regime' where fast processes are approximately in equilibrium. We also consider perturbations by instantaneous doubling of CO$_2$ and similarly find a strong dependence on the climate state using our approach.},

               tipping points as a mechanism for past abrupt climate changes.
               In the model, changes in a control parameter, which could for
               instance be related to changes in the atmospheric circulation,
               induce sequential tipping of sea ice cover and the ocean's
               meridional overturning circulation. The ocean component,
               represented by the well-known Stommel box model, is shown to
               display so-called rate-induced tipping. Here, an abrupt
               resurgence of the overturning circulation is induced before a
               bifurcation point is reached due to the fast rate of change of
               the sea ice. Because of the multi-scale nature of the climate
               system, this type of tipping cascade may also be a risk
               concerning future global warming. The relatively short
               timescales involved make it challenging to detect these tipping
               points from observations. However, with our conceptual model we
               find that there can be a significant delay in the tipping
               because the system is attracted by the stable manifold of a
               saddle during the rate-induced transition before escaping
               towards the undesired state. This opens up the possibility for
               an early warning of the impending abrupt transition via
               detection of the changing linear stability in the vicinity of
               the saddle. To do so, we propose estimating the Jacobian from

abstract = {Satellite measurements and radiative calculations show that Earth's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is an essentially linear function of surface temperature over a wide range of temperatures (≳60 K). Linearity implies that radiative forcing has the same impact in warmer as in colder climates and is thus of fundamental importance for understanding past and future climate change. Although the evidence for a nearly linear relation was first pointed out more than 50 y ago, it is still unclear why this relation is valid and when it breaks down. Here we present a simple semianalytical model that explains Earth's linear OLR as an emergent property of an atmosphere whose greenhouse effect is dominated by a condensable gas. Linearity arises from a competition between the surface's increasing thermal emission and the narrowing of spectral window regions with warming and breaks down at high temperatures once continuum absorption cuts off spectral windows. Our model provides a way of understanding the longwave contribution to Earth's climate sensitivity and suggests that extrasolar planets with other condensable greenhouse gases could have climate dynamics similar to Earth's.},

@article{Soedergren2018,
abstract = {We examine the effects of non-linear interactions between surface albedo, water vapor and cloud cover (referred to as climate variables) on amplified warming of the polar regions, using a new energy balance model. Our simulations show that the sum of the contributions to surface temperature changes due to any variable considered in isolation is smaller than the temperature changes from coupled feedback simulations. This non-linearity is strongest when all three climate variables are allowed to interact. Surface albedo appears to be the strongest driver of this non-linear behavior, followed by water vapor and clouds. This is because increases in longwave radiation absorbed by the surface, related to increases in water vapor and clouds, and increases in surface absorbed shortwave radiation caused by a decrease in surface albedo, amplify each other. Furthermore, our results corroborate previous findings that while increases in cloud cover and water vapor, along with the greenhouse effect itself, warm the polar regions, water vapor also significantly warms equatorial regions, which reduces polar amplification. Changes in surface albedo drive large changes in absorption of incoming shortwave radiation, thereby enhancing surface warming. Unlike high latitudes, surface albedo change at low latitudes are more constrained. Interactions between surface albedo, water vapor and clouds drive larger increases in temperatures in the polar regions compared to low latitudes. This is in spite of the fact that, due to a forcing, cloud cover increases at high latitudes and decreases in low latitudes, and that water vapor significantly enhances warming at low latitudes.},

abstract = {Clear sky emittance models provide critical information for the determination of downwelling longwave irradiance at the Earth's surface. This study updates existing calculations which relate clear sky longwave emissivity with the main (and most variable) greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, water vapor. Impacts of station elevation and data quality control are quantified. Empirical results are used to validate highly resolved spectral models, and the resultant simplified calculates provide accurate estimations of clear sky emissivity without the need for extensive computation. Results show that correlation coefficients are mostly robust to nuanced data processing choices when regressed from sufficiently large data sets (≥104 samples) with the exceptions of altitude adjustment and measurement bias corrections. The empirical results from this study are compared to results from other leading empirical, physics-based, and hybridized phenomenological models. Correlations for effective clear sky emissivity, transmissivity and optical depth are provided, based on parameterized line-by-line (LBL) model results, for the broadband 0–2,500 cm−1 and for seven wavenumber wideband of interest. Results for the (b3) wideband 580–750 cm−1 are particularly relevant because of its disaggregated and combined carbon dioxide-water vapor contributions. The broadband effective optical depth ($\delta$) of water vapor is found to be (Formula presented.), where pw is the dimensionless partial pressure of water vapor at the surface. Equivalently, the broadband effective optical depth of carbon dioxide in the presence of water vapor is found to be (Formula presented.). Processed training data sets are provided as supplementary content for comparative studies.},

abstract = {Decoupling during the "Lagrangian" evolution of a cloud-topped boundary layer advected equatorward by the trade winds in an idealized eastern subtropical ocean is studied using a mixed-layer model (MLM). The sea surface temperature is gradually warmed while the free tropospheric sounding remains unchanged, causing the boundary layer to deepen, the surface relative humidity to decrease, and surface latent heat fluxes to increase. Diurnally averaged insolation is used. For entrainment closures in which entrainment rate is related to a large-eddy convective velocity scale w*, the MLM predicts an increasingly prominent layer of negative buoyancy fluxes below cloud base as the sea surface temperature warms. Decoupling of the mixed layer can be inferred when the MLM-predicted negative buoyancy fluxes become too large for the internal circulations to sustain. The authors show that decoupling is mainly driven by an increasing ratio of the surface latent heat flux to the net radiative cooling in the cloud, and derive a decoupling criterion based on this ratio. Other effects such as drizzle, the vertical distribution of radiative cooling in the cloud, and sensible heat fluxes, also affect decoupling but are shown to be less important in typical subtropical boundary layers. A comparison of MLM results with a companion numerical study with a cloud-resolving model shows that the decoupling process is similar and the same decoupling criterion applies. A regional analysis of decoupling using Lagrangian trajectories based on summertime northeast Pacific climatology predicts decoupling throughout the subtropical stratocumulus region except in coastal zones where the boundary layer is under 750 m deep. A "flux-partitioning" entrainment closure, in which the entrainment rate is chosen to maintain a specified ratio of some measure of negative subcloud buoyancy fluxes to positive buoyancy fluxes within the cloud and near the surface, was also considered. By construction, such an MLM never predicts its own breakdown by decoupling. The changed entrainment closure had only a minor influence on the boundary layer evolution and entrainment rate. Instead, the crucial impact of the entrainment closure is on predicting when and where the mixed-layer assumption will break down due to decoupling.},

abstract = {We review bulk representations of tropical and subtropical maritime atmospheric boundary layers. Three types of bulk representations are studied in detail: stratocumulus topped mixed layers, trade-wind layers, and sub-cloud mixed layers. Through the development of a consistent description of these disparate regimes, connections among their varied representations are emphasized, as well as their relation to regions of deeper convection. New results relating to the equilibrium mass flux and cloud fraction in the trade winds; the ability of bulk models to represent qualitatively major cloud regimes; and the relationship amongst different bulk representations of the surface layer are presented. Throughout we emphasize the identification of consistent and physically based mixing and cloud regime rules for use in intermediate complexity models of the tropical climate, which in turn can be used to study cloud and dynamical interactions on larger scales. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Stratocumulus clouds cover 20% of subtropical oceans and strongly cool the Earth by reflecting incoming shortwave radiation. Because of their small dynamical scales and their sensitivity to changing meteorological conditions, the response of stratocumulus clouds to climate change is one of the leading uncertainties in climate modeling. Recent work has made significant progress constraining this feedback using high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) and satellite observations. Here we provide complementary constraints from a theoretical perspective, using a bulk boundary layer model to calculate the response of stratocumulus clouds to increasing CO 2. We extend the bulk model presented in Singer and Schneider (2023) by coupling it to a slab ocean to allow for feedbacks between cloud cover and surface warming and use ensemble Kalman inversion to calibrate model parameters. We conduct climate change experiments, forcing the bulk model with increasing CO 2 , and compare the cloud response to results from LES in Schneider et al. (2019). Past a critical CO 2 value, the cloud layer decouples from the surface, the clouds break up, and cloud fraction decreases to a shallow cumulus-like state. Cloud fraction shows hysteresis behavior, where the system remains in a low cloud fraction state even as CO 2 is decreased significantly past the breakup threshold. The hysteresis behavior is robust, but the critical CO 2 value is sensitive to parameters and assumptions of the bulk model. We show that surface warming and water vapor feedback are two important aspects of the breakup; without them, the critical CO 2 threshold for breakup is much larger. 5 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study, and the companion paper Singer and Schneider (2023), is to develop a simple model to explain mechanisms controlling stratocumulus-cumulus transitions. In this second paper, we describe the extended bulk model coupled to a slab ocean that is forced only with a prescribed CO 2 concentration. We calibrate key parameters of this model based on high-resolution simulations. The simple model, like the high-resolution simulations, shows that stratocumulus clouds break up at very high CO 2 concentrations and that the boundary layer exhibits hysteresis, remaining in a cumulus-like state until CO 2 is reduced significantly past the breakup threshold. We conclude by showing a series of mechanism-denial experiments that highlight the importance of surface temperature and water vapor feedbacks on the stratocumulus breakup.},
