    CloudToppedMixedLayerModel

Submodule providing processes about cloud topped mixed layer models (MLMs).
This combines existing equations on MLM by [Stevens2006](@cite) and [Bretherton1997](@cite),
with surface energy balance and dynamic cloud equations.
It is developed as part of the research article [Datseris2025](@cite).
If you use this submodule, please cite the paper.

The organization is as follows:

- All important variables and parameters (participate in many processes)
  are defined in the module file and as module-level scoped
  variables (global variables). Click the "source" of this docstring
  to access the module file.
- All processes (physical equations) are defined in their respective files
  such as `free_troposhere.jl`, etc. Docstrings of important processes
  are expanded in the docs here. You will notice that all functions that
  return processes (equations) utilize these global variables and global parameters.
  Many of these functions will also define local variables and parameters.
  All noteworthy processes have docstrings that are expanded in the submodule online
  documentation. However, the majority of docstrings do not actually list
  the equations themselves. Simply click the "source code" button on the bottom
  right of each docstring to go to the source code. Because this package is written
  in Julia, and because it uses symbolic expressions throughout, reading the source
  code is truly as straight forward as reading Latex-rendered equations.
- The `default.jl` file defines default processes for many global variables.
  These are also expanded in the docs.

Throughout the submodule time is in units of days, specific humidity is in units of g/kg,
liquid water static energy is in units of K (i.e., normalized by c‚Çö),
height in meters, temperature in K, and all energy quantities are in W/m¬≤.

To learn how to use this submodule visit first the general tutorial of ConceptualClimateModels.jl
and then the dedicated example on a cloudy mixed layer model.
The module purposefully does not export any names, so the recommended way to use it
is by an alias: `import ConceptualClimateModels.CloudToppedMixedLayerModel as CTMLM`.
